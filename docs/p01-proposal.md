## Introduction
In our project, our goal is to analyze and investigate the effect of intersectionality on system of oppression through examining existing high school graduation rate. For example, the datasets on high school graduates we discovered only included male and female. We want to adapt more diverse pronoun conventions, so we must focus on collecting diverse data on what individuals represent and choose to be. This will support us in resolving the design issue of having limited options for students to identify themselves, which is an act of advocating for equity that will benefit majority of population, a “co-liberation” process. Why do schools and data design have limited student identifiers? We want to enable students' preferences for being addressed and hope to highlight correlation with intersectionality and socioeconomic status.

## Abstract
Our main concern is correlation between intersectionality and a system of oppression based on social identity. Our question is how does gender, race, and social economic status affect equal education opportunities. To address this question, we analyzed the datasets of differences in graduation rates based on gender, race, and social economic status.

## Keywords
graduation rate, social justice, race, gender, social economic status

## Problem Domain
We investigated the data of U.S high school graduation rates and encountered that the data sets only have male and female listed. We only have data that shows the graduation rate in high school by male or female. In Statista it shows the percentage of graduates increasing from 39.5-90.6% from 1960-2021 If we want to adapt to our societies current standards where the stakeholders have the right to identify who they are by choice we can start modeling and collecting new data on what a person chooses to be. This will help us tackle the design situation where the data we collect only categorizes the students under male or female. Throughout the years. The cultural and social question to be addressed is why aren’t school’s or the data design including other types of identifications for students? The benefits will be that by diving deeper into the root and understanding of students' personal choice to be voiced in what they want to be addressed as. We can collect data on not only male or female but by what the person chooses to identify as. This will help future data sets start building a history of percentages to help us clean up data on the graduation rates of human’s who don’t categorize themselves as male or female. Therefore the more data collected the more we can get more specific on how to improve graduation rates. We are also tackling the data of graduation rates by household lower and higher household income collected from 2015-19. This data shows the graduation rates from kids that did qualify for free lunch and those who didn’t. The lower income students' graduation rate was 78% in those five years compared to the higher income students averaging 90.6% graduation rates. This raises the cultural and social question if lower income students aren’t getting the right resources to graduate. How do we explore solutions based on income and needs to increase this percentage?  Our third data this data set proves the 4-Year graduation rates in iowa by cohort by race and ethnicity starting withthe class of 2013.

## Research question
* How does gender identity affect high school graduation rate?
* How does racial identity affect high school graduation rate?
* How does social status affect high school graduation rate?

## The Dataset

![How far can North Korea's Missile Reach?](/docs/table.png "Dataset Table")

For our group’s final project, we will be analyzing and working with datasets of social factors affecting high school graduation rate to further aim to include and represent diversity within gender and race of our target audience, students and academic organizations. We would be looking at data of gender, ethnicity, and social class of graduation rate in US from 2010 - 2019 provided by Statista and Tyler Data & Insights. The datasets will be visualized the number of high school graduates based on race, gender, and class. From analyzing the data, our group will gain knowledge of how much does social factor affect individual’s education opportunity. Our stakeholders are local public boards of education to enable an environment where individuals can equally achieve the same quality of education regardless of their racial, gender, or class background.

## Expected Implication
- Our group expect to apply our founding of correlation between social background and graduation rate to future educational system to achieve co-liberation, where every student can receive benefit.
- Our group expects through visualization of datasets, we want to see a trend of social background and graduation rate to improve equality in education

## Limitations
* We cannot cover the graduation data of all high schools in the United States for analysis and research. Therefore, we search for data from websites or research institutes for analysis.
*  Everyone's social, cultural, and experiential backgrounds and perspectives are unique. Thus, there are a great deal of social elements that will influence one person, not all of which will be addressed by our project. However, we will focus on three main social factors (gender identity, racial identity, and social status) in our project.
