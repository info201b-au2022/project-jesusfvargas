## Introduction
In our project, our goal is to analyze and investigate the effect of intersectionality on system of oppression through examining existing high school graduation rate. For example, the datasets on high school graduates we discovered only included male and female. We want to adapt more diverse pronoun conventions, so we must focus on collecting diverse data on what individuals represent and choose to be. This will support us in resolving the design issue of having limited options for students to identify themselves, which is an act of advocating for equity that will benefit majority of population, a “co-liberation” process. Why do schools and data design have limited student identifiers? We want to enable students' preferences for being addressed and hope to highlight correlation with intersectionality and socioeconomic status.

## Abstract
Our main concern is correlation between intersectionality and a system of oppression based on social identity. Our question is how does gender, race, and social economic status affect equal education opportunities. To address this question, we analyzed the datasets of differences in graduation rates based on gender, race, and social economic status.

## Keywords
graduation rate, social justice, race, gender, social economic status

## Problem Domain
We investigated the data of high school graduates and encountered that the data sets only have male and female listed. We only have data that shows the graduation rate in high school by male or female. If we want to adapt to our societies current standards where we use pronouns to describe who we are by choice, we should start collecting data on what a person represents and chooses to be. This will help us tackle the design situation where the data we collect only categorizes the students under male or female. Throughout the years  The cultural and social question to be addressed is why aren’t school’s or the data design including other types of identifications for students? We want to dive deep into the root and understanding of students' personal choice to be voiced in what they want to be addressed as. By tackling this domain we can collect data on not only male or female but by what the person goes by. This will help future data sets start building a history of percentages to help dive deeper into graduation rates of human’s who don’t categorize themselves as male or female. Therefore the more data collected the more we can get more specific on how to improve graduation rates.

## Research question
* How does gender identity affect high school graduation rate?
* How does racial identity affect high school graduation rate?
* How does social status affect high school graduation rate?

## The Dataset

For our group’s final project, we will be analyzing and working with datasets of social factors affecting high school graduation rate to further aim to include and represent diversity within gender and race of our target audience, students and academic organizations. We would be looking at data of gender, ethnicity, and social class of graduation rate in US from 2010 - 2019 provided by Statista and Tyler Data & Insights. The datasets will be visualized the number of high school graduates based on race, gender, and class. From analyzing the data, our group will gain knowledge of how much does social factor affect individual’s education opportunity. Our stakeholders are local public boards of education to enable an environment where individuals can equally achieve the same quality of education regardless of their racial, gender, or class background.


## Limitations
* We cannot cover the graduation data of all high schools in the United States for analysis and research. Therefore, we search for data from websites or research institutes for analysis.
*  Everyone's social, cultural, and experiential backgrounds and perspectives are unique. Thus, there are a great deal of social elements that will influence one person, not all of which will be addressed by our project. However, we will focus on three main social factors (gender identity, racial identity, and social status) in our project.
