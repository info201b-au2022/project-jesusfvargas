## 1. Abstract:
Our main concern is correlation between intersectionality and a system of oppression based on social identity. Our question is how does gender, race, and social economic status affect equal education opportunities. To address this question, we analyzed the datasets of differences in graduation rates based on gender, race, and social economic status.

## 2. Keywords:
graduation rate, social justice, race, gender, social economic status

## 3. Introduction
In our project, our goal is to analyze and investigate the effect of intersectionality on system of oppression through examining existing high school graduation rate. For example, the datasets on high school graduates we discovered only included male and female. We want to adapt more diverse pronoun conventions, so we must focus on collecting diverse data on what individuals represent and choose to be. This will support us in resolving the design issue of having limited options for students to identify themselves, which is an act of advocating for equity that will benefit majority of population, a “co-liberation” process. Why do schools and data design have limited student identifiers? We want to enable students' preferences for being addressed and hope to highlight correlation with intersectionality and socioeconomic status.

## 4. Problem Domain

We investigated the data of U.S high school graduation rates and encountered that the data sets only have male and female listed.

* **Background**: We investigated the data of U.S high school graduation rates and encountered that the data sets only have male and female listed. We only have data that shows the graduation rate in high school by male or female. In Statista, it shows the percentage of graduates increasing from 39.5-90.6% from 1960-2021 If we want to adapt to our societies current standards where the stakeholders have the right to identify who they are by choice we can start modeling and collecting new data on what a person chooses to be.

* **Direct and Indirect Stakeholders**:
The stakeholders are not only students but also school administrators. We only have data that shows the graduation rate in high school by male or female. In Statista it shows the percentage of graduates increasing from 39.5-90.6% from 1960-2021. If we want to adapt to our societies current standards where the stakeholders, students, have the right to identify who they are by choice, we can encourage the administrators to be more inclusive and start modeling and collecting new data on what each student chooses to be. This will help us tackle the design situation where the data we collect only categorizes the students under male or female.

* **Human Values**:
The cultural and social question to be addressed is why aren’t school’s or the data design including other types of identifications for students? Additionally, the lower income students' graduation rate was 78% in those five years compared to the higher income students averaging 90.6% graduation rates. This raises the cultural and social question if lower income students aren’t getting the right resources to graduate. How do we explore solutions based on income and needs to increase this percentage?


* **Potential Benefits and Harms**: The benefits will be that by diving deeper into the root and understanding of students' personal choice to be voiced in what they want to be addressed as. We can collect data on not only male or female, but on what the person chooses to identify as. This will help future data sets start building a history of percentages to help us clean up data on the graduation rates of human’s who don’t categorize themselves as male or female. Therefore the more data collected the more we can get more specific on how to improve graduation rates. We are also tackling the data of graduation rates by household lower and higher household income collected from 2015-19. This data shows the graduation rates from kids that did qualify for free lunch and those who didn’t. Our third data this data set proves the 4-Year graduation rates in Iowa by cohort by race and ethnicity starting with the class of 2013. The harms are the datasets where there are limited pronoun by only marking female, male, or genderX. Another harm is that the datasets are organized in a confused way of where it does not specifically state if each row is information about a single or group of student. Yet, from the analyzing the datasets, we came to conclusion that each row represents information of a single student.

## 5. Research question
* How does one's gender identity affect the percentage of high school students who graduate?
 > Important as a person's gender identification is, such inquiries may aid in gaining a deeper understanding of the motivations behind students' personal decisions, therefore fostering a more varied and inclusive environment.

* How does one's racial identity affect the percentage of high school students who graduate?
 > We live in an era of multicultural and multiracial coexistence, so we must investigate the extent to which racial identity influences a student in this context.

* How does a person's social status affect their likelihood of graduating from high school, and is it possible to judge that the prevalence of education is closely related to the social status of family members?
 > In most cases, income is used to categorize social classes. Whether low-income students have access to graduation resources comparable to those of high-income students raises cultural and social concerns. Therefore, this question is very important.

## 6. The Dataset

* **Dataset**:
For our group’s final project, we will be analyzing and working with datasets of social factors affecting high school graduation rate to further aim to include and represent diversity within gender and race of our target audience, students and academic organizations.

* **Dataset Source and Goal**:
We would be looking at data of gender, ethnicity, and social class of graduation rate in US from 2010 - 2019 provided by Statista and Tyler Data & Insights. The datasets will be visualized the number of high school graduates based on race, gender, and class. From analyzing the data, our group will gain knowledge of how much does social factor affect individual’s education opportunity. Our stakeholders are local public boards of education to enable an environment where individuals can equally achieve the same quality of education regardless of their racial, gender, or class background.

## 7. Expected Implication
- Our group expect to apply our founding of correlation between social background and graduation rate to future educational system to achieve co-liberation, where every student can receive benefit.
- Our group expects through visualization of datasets, we want to see a trend of social background and graduation rate to improve equality in education

## 8. Limitations
* We cannot cover the graduation data of all high schools in the United States for analysis and research. Therefore, we search for data from websites or research institutes for analysis.
*  Everyone's social, cultural, and experiential backgrounds and perspectives are unique. Thus, there are a great deal of social elements that will influence one person, not all of which will be addressed by our project. However, we will focus on three main social factors (gender identity, racial identity, and social status) in our project.

## 9. Findings:
The **gender identity** chart reveals that both the number of students who identify as genderX and the rate at which they graduate are quite low, indicating that this demographic belongs to a minority group. When we look at male and female students separately, we find that the total number of students in both groups is about the same. However, the graduation rate of female students is much higher when compared to the graduation rate of male students.

When we look at the chart that summarizes **racial identity**, we can see that the graduation rate of the Asian group is higher than the graduation rate of the other groups, comparing with the white group with the second highest graduation rate still much higher. The graduation rate of the American Indian group is relatively low. Graduation rates for other groups were roughly flat.

By looking at the graph of **Income identity**, we can see that the percentage of students from low-income households who graduate high school is much lower than the percentage of students from high-income groups who graduate. The average graduation rate of low-income groups is approximately 10% lower than that of high-income groups. Furthermore, the graduation rate of high-income groups has remained stable over the past three years at approximately 86%, while the graduation rate of low-income groups has remained approximately 76% . However, it is important to keep in mind that regardless of whether one is referring to a high-income group or a low-income group, the rate of graduation for both types of groupings has consistently been on the increase.

## 10. Discussion:

When discussing **gender identity**, the distinction between **gender and sex** should be addressed first. The **biological state** of a person, designated as either male or female, is their sex. In contrast, a **person's gender** relates to how society perceives him or her to be a man, woman, girl, or boy. Gender identity transcends an individual's external presentation. **It is fundamental awareness**. Typically, our gender identities correspond with the sex given to us at birth, but for transgender and gender fluid individuals, their sense of self may not quite correspond with their biology. It is crucial to recognize gender identity as a social construction. Gender expression is how we convey our gender identification to others, and everyone expresses their gender differently. Therefore, it is very important for our research and understanding. It helps us build a more diverse society and have a deeper understanding of our gender identity explore the impact that intersectionality has on existing systems of oppression. Young people benefit from their own ethnic and racial origins when they encounter or witness prejudice because they have a greater grasp of the environment in which they live. For this reason, it is very important.

We can see from the data that various income group have a particular influence on the percentage of students who graduate from high school. The percentage of students from high-income families who graduate from high school is, in comparison, a pretty high number. This leads us to believe that people from various economic brackets place varying amounts of weight on education and have access to a variety of educational opportunities. As a result, this kind of study enables us to devote greater attention to the problem of popularizing education according to a variety of models and to make consistent modifications.

## 11. Conclusion:

By analyzing the **current rate at which high school students graduate**, the purpose of this study is to explore and assess the impact that intersectionality has on existing systems of oppression. One of the examples we saw was that the databases on high school graduates only included male and female graduates. If we are going to implement pronoun rules that are more inclusive of a wider range of identities, then we need to prioritize the collection of varied data on what people identify as and what they choose to be. This would be helpful to us in addressing the design problem of having few possibilities for kids to identify themselves, which is an act of advocating for equality that will benefit the majority of the population and is a process known as **"co-liberation."** Why do schools and their data designs only have so many ways to identify students? We wish to bring attention to the **link** between socioeconomic standing and intersectionality, and we want to make it possible for the preferences of students to be taken into account.

Our primary concern is the link that exists between **intersectionality and an oppressive system** that is founded on social identity. Our inquiry is on the ways in which gender, racial identity, and socioeconomic standing interact with equitable educational opportunities. In order to get an answer to this issue, we investigated the datasets that included information on variances in graduation rates according to factors such as **gender, race, and socioeconomic level**.

By collecting information that enables readers to evaluate the **effect of intersectionality** on pre-existing structures of oppression, one of the **primary objectives** of our project is to improve the visibility of marginalized groups and strengthen their advocacy. And, let more people have their voices and needs heard; second, let more people realize how much social factors have an impact on a person's development; and third, make an effort to contribute to the construction of a society that is harmonious and diverse.
